## Settings

**You can also adjust these settings through the in-game settings menu.**

The game settings are stored in the `settings.json` file. You can modify the following parameters:

- **Attempts Count**: Set the number of attempts allowed (`attempts_count`). Use `"infinity"` for unlimited attempts.
- **Random Number Range**: Define the range of random numbers (`random_number_range_1` and `random_number_range_2`).

Example `settings.json`:

``` JSON
{
    "attempts_count": "infinity",
    "random_number_range_1": 1,
    "random_number_range_2": 100,
    "hints_enabled": false
}
```

## Additional Notes

- The `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary files (e.g., `__pycache__`, environment files) are not tracked by Git.
- The `python-app.yml` workflow automates testing and packaging for the project. It includes steps for code formatting, dependency installation, and creating a distributable archive.
